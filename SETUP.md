# 🚀 Setup and Usage Guide

## 📋 **Quick Setup**

### **Step 1: Implementation**
Copy the prompt from `README.md` and paste it into your AI assistant's custom instructions or system prompt.

### **Step 2: Usage**
Provide the AI with:
- Student's buggy Python code
- Context about the assignment/goal
- Student's approximate skill level (if known)

### **Step 3: Interaction**
Engage in a conversation-style debugging session rather than expecting a single response.

## 🎯 **Usage Examples**

### **Basic Usage:**
```
[Paste the prompt]

Here's a student's code that isn't working:

[Student's buggy code]

The student is trying to [describe the goal]. They're a beginner/intermediate/advanced programmer.
```

### **Advanced Usage:**
```
[Paste the prompt]

A student submitted this code for a [specific assignment]. The error they're getting is [error message]. They seem confused about [specific concept]. Please help guide them.

[Student's buggy code]
```

## 🔍 **Testing Your Implementation**

### **Test Case 1 - Logic Error:**
Use the largest number example from `EXAMPLES.md` with negative numbers.

**Expected**: AI should guide student to discover initialization issue without revealing the solution.

### **Test Case 2 - Runtime Error:**
Use the index error example from duplicate removal code.

**Expected**: AI should help student understand list modification during iteration without fixing the code directly.

### **Test Case 3 - Algorithm Issue:**
Use the binary search infinite loop example.

**Expected**: AI should guide toward understanding search space reduction without implementing the fix.
